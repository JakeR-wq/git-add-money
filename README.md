### Java app built with a team of 5 including me for CSCE247.  
This app is meant to mirror the functionality of Degree Works, a website that is commonly used by students at UofSC to see their degree progession and choose classes.  

I contributed by writing almost all of the backend, which consisted of loading the objects with data from the database (JSON documents).
